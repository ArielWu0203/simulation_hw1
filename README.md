## Q1
Draw the distribution of the number of the WAPs that are detected on a single capture.
## Q2
Draw the distribution of RSSI value that are detected (eliminate RSSI=0).
## Q3
Draw the distribution of the (1)mean„ÄÅmedian and (2)standard deviation of each WAP.
## Q4
Use the data of the WAP with the lowest mean (you can get it from Q3), 
and draw its PDF and CDF of the RSSI distribution of different buildings (BUILDINGID 0~2). 
(you should compare the difference between three building and write your discoveries)
